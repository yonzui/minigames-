# about
i developed a a minigame website, with rock paper scissors, a memory game, and pong! i thought it would be fun to practice some javascript through game dev. i also used html and css, and made this in vscode! this was made apart of hack club's athena award.

# how to play
rock, paper, scissors: click on the rock, paper, or scissor symbol to play against a computer.
pong: use w and s to move the left paddle up and down. use the up and down arrows to control the right paddle.
memory game: click on two pairs of red squares to get a match! keep trying until all squares are white.

# struggles
the biggest struggle for me was the memory game. i was like "why is this not working??", and then realized it was better for me to organize it into its own, seperate js file. i tried soooo many different things, which is why i was so relieved when i fixed it. i also had some styling issues with the memory game that caused some issues, but i was able to figure it out!
